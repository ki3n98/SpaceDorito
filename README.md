# SpaceDorito

The goal for this project was for me to learn the basic of SFML and ECS architecture, 
and I think I've accomplished it. 

I did not use any texture nor sound. So, I'm planning to learn that on my next project. 
Hopefully, I will also be able to create a custom physic engine for the next project.
